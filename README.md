# GMOAT Trailers

Source code for my first project for the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) program from Udacity. Most of it is from the [Programming Foundations with Python](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud036) course. 

This project is a single page web app displaying a list of the Greatest Movies Of All Time. Clicking on any movie will launch its Youtube trailer.

## Installation

None, just download the gmoat.html file and open it with your favorite web browser.

### If you want to make change to the movie list:

Fork this repository to create your own copy in GitHub. Then clone your repository to make change locally on your computer. 
Add or remove movies by editing _entertainment_center.py_ with your favorite text editor then run it:
```
python entertainment_center.py
```

## Requirements

You will need Python installed on your computer to generate the html file and a web browser to open it.
